#add_expense function
#ask user for their name (make sure it is a valid name and not a number)
#ask the user to put a description of their expense (make sure it is a valid String and not numbers)
#to validate we can use try-except
#ask the user to input an amount

#all of this will be appended to a list in data.py
#we may need to use 2D list for all of this. in a 2D list we can store multiple lists inside. look at list2examples folder
#for 2D list examples

#view_all_expenses function
#we will print each item in the list (formatted correctly)
#we can use a for loop to go through the entire list
#since it is a 2D list we can use the index of the inner lists to print each item correctly
#ex list = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
#in the for loop we can check the index for each item in the list [1,2,3] and print them out separately

#split_summary function:
#we ask the user to input the amount of people they want to split all the expenses in the list 
#this number will be used to divide the total expenses later

#we show the total of all expenses in the list:
#we can use a for loop to go through the outer list
#we check each inner list and check index 2 which will contain the expenses 
#the user inputs 3 things so we know the index is 0-2 and the third thing they entered was expense (which will be index 2)
#we can use format to print it out to 2 decimal places

#we can check the length of the outer list to get the number of expenses

#once we get the total expenses and the length of the outer list we can get the average
#avg = total_expenses / outerlist_length
#we can then use format to print it out to 2 decimal places

#while we go through the loop earlier to get the total expense we can check which if it is the highest expense every time and save it
#maybe we can use the max() function from lists? if not then we can manually check with an if statement

#lowest expense we can do the opposite of highest expense. check which is the lowest and save it. maybe we can use min() function
#from lists?

#for equal share we can divide the users input from earlier and divide total with it
#total_expenses / num_of_people
